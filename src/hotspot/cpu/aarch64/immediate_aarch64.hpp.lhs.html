31  * functions to map backwards and forwards between logical or floating
32  * point immediates and their corresponding encodings. the mapping
33  * from encoding to immediate is required by the simulator. the reverse
34  * mapping is required by the OpenJDK assembler.
35  *
36  * a logical immediate value supplied to or returned from a map lookup
37  * is always 64 bits. this is sufficient for looking up 32 bit
38  * immediates or their encodings since a 32 bit immediate has the same
39  * encoding as the 64 bit immediate produced by concatenating the
40  * immediate with itself.
41  *
42  * a logical immediate encoding is 13 bits N:immr:imms (3 fields of
43  * widths 1:6:6 -- see the arm spec). they appear as bits [22:10] of a
44  * logical immediate instruction. encodings are supplied and returned
45  * as 32 bit values. if a given 13 bit immediate has no corresponding
46  * encoding then a map lookup will return 0xffffffff.
