 47 /* decode_instructions -- dump a range of addresses as native instructions
 48    This implements the protocol required by the HotSpot PrintAssembly option.
 49 
 50    The start_va, end_va is the virtual address the region of memory to
 51    disasemble and buffer contains the instructions to decode,
 52    Disassembling instructions in the current address space is done by
 53    having start_va == buffer.
 54 
 55    The option string, if not empty, is interpreted by the disassembler implementation.
 56 
 57    The printf callback is &#39;fprintf&#39; or any other workalike.
 58    It is called as (*printf_callback)(printf_stream, &quot;some format...&quot;, some, format, args).
 59 
 60    The event callback receives an event tag (a string) and an argument (a void*).
 61    It is called as (*event_callback)(event_stream, &quot;tag&quot;, arg).
 62 
 63    Events:
 64      &lt;insn pc=&#39;%p&#39;&gt;             begin an instruction, at a given location
 65      &lt;/insn pc=&#39;%d&#39;&gt;            end an instruction, at a given location
 66      &lt;addr value=&#39;%p&#39;/&gt;         emit the symbolic value of an address
 67 
 68    A tag format is one of three basic forms: &quot;tag&quot;, &quot;/tag&quot;, &quot;tag/&quot;,
 69    where tag is a simple identifier, signifying (as in XML) a element start,
 70    element end, and standalone element.  (To render as XML, add angle brackets.)
